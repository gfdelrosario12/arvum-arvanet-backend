/**
 * Lightweight, per-node snapshot of the newest telemetry values known to the backend.
 *
 * <p>Designed for the ArvaLink Home Dashboard, which polls the latest values of every
 * visible node on a fixed interval. It deliberately carries only the fields the
 * dashboard renders (soil moisture, water level, battery, sensor health, connectivity
 * and the telemetry timestamp) so the payload stays small even when the telemetry
 * history table grows to millions of rows.</p>
 *
 * <p>A {@code null} measurement means "the node has never reported this sensor", which is
 * different from a reported numeric {@code 0}. The dashboard renders those two cases
 * differently.</p>
